### Technologies

#### Front stack

- Angular as Javascript framework
- Compass as CSS framework
- Grunt as task manager (minify, test ...)

#### Server stack

- Php without framework (a bit of SF2 component)
- Php elasticSearch library
- Nginx as HTTP server
- ElasticSearch 1.4 as ... elasticsearch server
- ICU and Phonetic plugins
- Hosted on SubitoLabs cloud

And a lot of magic!

#### How it works ?

Add some filters, you can click on "+" button to browse existing filter (this will add default options as well), then you can add some analyzers (this is optional), end click on "Run test" et voil√†!

Php API will call elasticSearch _analyze API for each filters and each analyzers.
